# RP2040-Devkit 
This is a development board embedding a very popular RP2040 Microcontroller developed by Raspberry Pi Foundation. The idea is to design a very basic set of hardware for people getting started with RP2040 who just need a custom Board other than RP2040 Pico or if they want to design their own.

## Description: Coming Soon.......
